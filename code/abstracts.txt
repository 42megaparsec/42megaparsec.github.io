In the presence of a huge number of possible purchase choices, ranks or ratings of items by others often play very important roles for a buyer to make a final purchase decision. Perfectly objective rating is an impossible task to achieve, and we often use an average rating built on how previous buyers estimated the quality of the product. The problem of using a simple average rating is that it can easily be polluted by careless users whose evaluation of products cannot be trusted, and by malicious spammers who try to bias the rating result on purpose. In this letter we suggest how trustworthiness of individual users can be systematically and quantitatively reflected to build a more reliable rating system. We compute the suitably defined reliability of each user based on the user's rating pattern for all products she evaluated. We call our proposed method as the deviation-based ranking, since the statistical significance of each user's rating pattern with respect to the average rating pattern is the key ingredient. We find that our deviation-based ranking method outperforms existing methods in filtering out careless random evaluators as well as malicious spammers.

The concept of community detection has long been used as a key device for handling the mesoscale structures in networks. Suitably conducted community detection reveals various embedded informative substructures of network topology. However, regarding the practical usage of community detection, it has always been a tricky problem to assign a reasonable community resolution for networks of interest. Because of the absence of the unanimously accepted criterion, most of the previous studies utilized rather ad hoc heuristics to decide the community resolution. In this work, we harness the concept of consistency in community structures of networks to provide the overall community resolution landscape of networks, which we eventually take to quantify the reliability of detected communities for a given resolution parameter. More precisely, we exploit the ambiguity in the results of stochastic detection algorithms and suggest a method that denotes the relative validity of community structures in regard to their stability of global and local inconsistency measures using multiple detection processes. Applying our framework to synthetic and real networks, we confirm that it effectively displays insightful fundamental aspects of community structures.

International trade networks are complex systems that consist of overlapping multiple trade blocs of varying sizes. However, the resulting structures of community detection in trade networks often fail to accurately represent the complexity of international trade. To address this issue, we propose a multiresolution framework that integrates information from a range of resolutions to consider trade communities of different sizes and reveal the hierarchical structure of trade networks and their constituent blocks. In addition, we introduce a measure called multiresolution membership inconsistency for each country, which demonstrates the positive correlation between a country’s structural inconsistency in terms of network topology and its vulnerability to external intervention in terms of economic and security functioning. Our findings show that network science-based approaches can effectively capture the complex interdependencies between countries and provide new metrics for evaluating the characteristics and behaviors of countries in both economic and political contexts.

We use the structure of a real distribution network of agricultural product in Korea and investigate how the change in the supply may affect the price changes in agents across the distribution network. In particular, we focus on the real network structure of cabbage distribution composed of various types of agents, from farms to consumers, and apply a dynamic model to describe how each participant reacts upon the change of input and output flow of products through the adjustment of price. Our main result implies that the effect of fluctuation of production quantity in the supplying participant can be nontrivial and the consumer price responds to such changes. We believe that our results can be useful to predict what will happen if the agricultural production changes much in the future due to the climate changes.

We propose an extended genetic algorithm (GA) with different local environmental conditions. Genetic entities, or configurations, are put on nodes in a ring structure, and location-dependent environmental conditions are applied for each entity. Our GA is motivated by the geographic aspect of natural evolution: Geographic isolation reduces the diversity in a local group, but at the same time, can enhance intergroup diversity. Mating the genetic entities across different environments can make it possible to search for a broad area of the fitness landscape. We validate our extended GA for finding the ground state of the three-dimensional spin-glass system and find that the use of different environmental conditions makes it possible to find the lower-energy spin configurations at relatively shorter computation time. Our extension of GA belongs to a meta-optimization method and thus can be applied for a broad research area in which finding the optimal state in a shorter computation time is the key problem.

In green plants, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are the predominant pigments bound to light-harvesting proteins. While the individual characteristics of these chlorophylls are well understood, the advantages of their coexistence remain unclear. In this study, we establish a method to simulate excitation energy transfer within the entire photosystem II supercomplex by using network analysis integrated with quantum dynamic calculations. We then investigate the effects of the coexistence of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b by comparing various chlorophyll compositions. Our results reveal that the natural chlorophyll composition allows the excited energy to preferentially flow through specific domains that act as safety valves, preventing downstream overflow. Our findings suggest that the light-harvesting proteins in a photosystem II supercomplex achieve evolutionary advantages with the natural chlorophyll a/b ratio, capturing light energy efficiently and safely across various light intensities. Using our framework, one can better understand how green plants harvest light energy and adapt to changing environmental conditions.

We study a way to set the natural frequency of a newly added oscillator in a growing network to enhance synchronization. Population growth is one of the typical features of many oscillator systems for which synchronization is required to perform their functions properly. Despite this significance, little has been known about synchronization in growing systems. We suggest effective growing schemes to enhance synchronization as the network grows under a predetermined rule. Specifically, we find that a method based on a link-wise order parameter outperforms that based on the conventional global order parameter. With simple solvable examples, we verify that the results coincide with intuitive expectations. The numerical results demonstrate that the approximate optimal values from the suggested method show a larger synchronization enhancement in comparison with other naïve strategies. The results also show that our proposed approach outperforms others over a wide range of coupling strengths.

The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide a mathematical argument concerning the modularity function, the results from real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process. The reorganization is characterized by a local drop in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.

Understanding the complex “warming chain” in sea regions is crucial for predicting the cascading impacts of oceanic heat interactions on global climate stability. This study employs network analysis to explore the interactions of sea surface temperature (SST) across oceanic regions, focusing on complex heat transfer dynamics. By applying a heat equation approach, sea regions are represented as nodes and their directional heat transfer relationships as edges, allowing the identification of key oceanic regions in terms of inward and outward heat distributions. The analysis highlights previously reported influential oceanic communities, such as those linked to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system and the mutual interactions between the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, and underscores the role of these regions in global heat distribution, offering insights into oceanic temperature dynamics and potential implications for climate stability.

The gravity model, inspired by Newton’s law of universal gravitation, has been a cornerstone in the analysis of trade flows between countries. In this model, each country is assigned an economic mass, where greater economic masses lead to stronger trade interactions. Traditionally, proxy variables like gross domestic product or other economic indicators have been used to approximate this economic mass. While these proxies offer convenient estimates of a country’s economic size, they lack a direct theoretical connection to the actual drivers of trade flows, potentially leading to inconsistencies and misinterpretations. To address these limitations, we present a data-driven, self-consistent numerical approach that infers economic mass directly from trade flow data, eliminating the need for arbitrary proxies. Our approach, tested on synthetic data, accurately reconstructs predefined embeddings and system attributes, demonstrating robust predictive accuracy and flexibility. When applied to real-world trade networks, our method not only captures trade flows with precision but also distinguishes a country’s intrinsic trade capacity from external factors, providing clearer insights into the key elements shaping the global trade landscape. This study marks a significant shift in the application of the gravity model, offering a more comprehensive tool for analyzing complex systems and revealing new insights across various fields, including global trade, traffic engineering, epidemic prevention, and infrastructure design.

In complex systems, synchronization plays a pivotal role underlying the coherent operation of various systems (networks) ranging from biology to technology. In a dynamic network, a link between nodes can be newly created implementing a new interaction in the network. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand how to enhance the synchronized state of a system especially when adding a new connection. This study investigates ways to enhance synchronization through optimal link addition, employing the Synchrony Alignment Function (SAF) and Adjusted Lyapunov Function (ALF) that assess the effects of new connections. By applying the ALF method to compare potential link additions, we identify two key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of link addition: the steady-state phase in the linearized dynamics, which we named the pseudo-steady-state phase, and the structural attributes of the network. By applying these methods across diverse network topologies, including Barabási–Albert, Erdős–Rényi, and Cayley tree models, we uncover the dominant role of the phase difference in promoting synchronization. This exploration offers new insights into the dynamics of network synchronization, highlighting the critical impact of specific factors on the efficacy of enhancing network coherence. Our findings also lay a foundation for further research into targeted strategies for network optimization.
